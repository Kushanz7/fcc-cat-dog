# Cat vs. Dog Image Classification using TensorFlow/Keras

This repository contains the code for an image classification project focused on distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras, employing various data augmentation techniques to improve generalization and achieve high accuracy on the standard Cats and Dogs dataset.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate model capable of classifying images as either belonging to the 'cat' or 'dog' category. The repository encompasses the entire workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation:

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Efficient loading of the Cats and Dogs dataset and preprocessing steps, including rescaling pixel values.
* **Extensive Data Augmentation:** Implementation of a wide range of data augmentation techniques (rotation, shifts, shear, zoom, flips, etc.) to increase the training data diversity and reduce overfitting.
* **Deep CNN Architecture:** A multi-layer Convolutional Neural Network architecture designed to learn complex features from the images.
* **Training Script:** A well-structured script to train the CNN model on the augmented training data, including monitoring validation performance and utilizing callbacks for optimization.
* **Evaluation Script:** Code to evaluate the trained model's performance on a held-out test dataset, reporting key metrics such as accuracy.
* **Visualization:** Generation of plots illustrating the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs. Additionally, the repository includes functionality to visualize the model's predictions on the test set.

## Dataset

This project leverages the widely used "Cats and Dogs" dataset, which contains a substantial number of labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset is typically divided into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate proper model development and evaluation.

> The dataset was obtained from [Assuming you used the FreeCodeCamp dataset]: [https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/cats-and-dogs/cats_and_dogs.zip](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/cats_and_dogs/cats_and_dogs.zip)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd cat_dog_classifier
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Create a `requirements.txt` file with at least `tensorflow`, `keras`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`)*

3.  **Download and prepare the dataset:**
    ```bash
    wget [https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/cats-and-dogs/cats_and_dogs.zip](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/cats-and-dogs/cats_and_dogs.zip)
    unzip cats_and_dogs.zip
    # The data will be organized into train, validation, and test directories.
    ```

4.  **Run the training script:**
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
    *(Assuming your training script is named `train_model.py`)*

5.  **Run the evaluation script:**
    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py
    ```
    *(Assuming your evaluation script is named `evaluate_model.py`)*

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional blocks, each containing `Conv2D` layers with ReLU activation and `MaxPooling2D` layers for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Batch normalization and dropout layers are incorporated to improve training stability and prevent overfitting. The final layers include a `Flatten` layer followed by dense layers and a sigmoid activation function in the output layer for binary classification.

## Data Augmentation

A comprehensive set of data augmentation techniques was applied during training to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen images. These techniques include:

* Random rotations (up to 70 degrees)
* Random horizontal and vertical shifts (up to 30% of width/height)
* Random shear transformations (up to 30%)
* Random zooming (up to a factor of 1.2)
* Random horizontal and vertical flips
* Nearest neighbor fill mode for handling newly created pixels.

## Results

The trained model achieved a test accuracy of **[Insert your final test accuracy here, e.g., 85.0%]** on the Cats and Dogs test dataset. The training and validation performance over epochs can be visualized in the `training_history.png` file (assuming you saved such a plot).

## Further Improvements

Potential avenues for further improvement include:

* Experimenting with deeper and more complex CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).
* Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model and optimizer.
* Exploring more advanced learning rate schedules and optimization algorithms.
* Implementing techniques to visualize misclassified images and understand model failures.
* Training on a larger and more diverse dataset if available.
